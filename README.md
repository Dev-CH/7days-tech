## TASK 2

#### Brief:

We have a simple project. It creates a random post 3 times a day on a blog page.
We would like to add 1 extra post generated per day, but that extra post should be created in a different way.
The existing script generates the random post 3 times a day. 
We want to add another 1 extra post per day (generated at 12pm). 
That extra post shouldn't have the random title, but instead, the title should be "Summary YYYY-MM-DD", where the date is the current day, when the post is generated.
The new extra post should contain only 1 paragraph (instead of 2 paragraphs normally)."

##### Please assume that somebody else will set up the cron jobs for the new extra post.

Donâ€™t implement unit tests.

** PROJECT DELIVERY **
Create a public GIT repository (e.g. GitHub), push the project there (without ./vendor/ folder) 
and send the URL to the repository to us.
